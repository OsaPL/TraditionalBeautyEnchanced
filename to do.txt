This is a project I started fiddling with like a year ago. I alwyas loved how Traditional beauty looked, and I was using it since 2012. Lately no new updates and overall "bogding" of the textures pack left me dissatisfied, and here it is.
Firstly I would want to thank anyone who had his input in this texture pack, mainly:
WomboCombo (BlowJoe), joedeluxe.
If you had any important input, you have any problems with me publishing updated pack, or anything personal, pm me.
For any suggestions, problems, bugs or anything other post below.
I used the original Minecraft Textures and just modified them. All rights go to Mojang.
